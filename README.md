**Overview**
DeepGenePredictor is a machine learning project aimed at predicting gene expression levels using a deep neural network. The project leverages PyTorch for building and training the model, and sklearn for data preprocessing and evaluation. The primary dataset used in this project is derived from gene expression levels in different samples.

**Features**
Data preprocessing including standardization
Neural network model definition using PyTorch
Training with K-Fold Cross-Validation
Model evaluation on test data
Comprehensive performance metrics

**Contents**
GeneExpress.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
README.md: This readme file

**Notebook Structure**
Importing Libraries: Necessary libraries are imported.
Loading and Displaying the Dataset: The dataset is loaded from an Excel file and its structure is displayed.
Preprocessing the Data: The data is preprocessed by separating features and target variables, splitting into training and testing sets, and standardizing the features.
Creating Data Loaders: PyTorch data loaders are created for efficient batching.
Defining the Neural Network Model: A neural network model is defined using PyTorch.
Training the Model with K-Fold Cross-Validation: The model is trained using K-Fold Cross-Validation and the performance is evaluated.
Final Evaluation on Test Set: The model's performance is evaluated on the test set to obtain the final test loss.

**Results**
Average Validation Loss: 0.0074
Final Test Loss: 0.0096
These results indicate that the model generalizes well from validation to test data, with low loss values suggesting strong performance.
